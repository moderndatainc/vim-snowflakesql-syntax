Enables SnowflakeSQL syntax highlighting.

## Installation

This repository is structured as a standard vim package / plugin.

Use your favourite package manager, or see `:h packages`.

tl;dr, assuming your vim runtime is in `~/.vim` and you don't yet have a
pereference for how to organise your packages:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/lang/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/lang/start
git clone https://github.com/moderndatainc/vim-snowflakesql-syntax.git
```
